        &emsp; &emsp; &ensp;
        Hi, my name is Luka Brown, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for coding!
        I first learned that I enjoyed coding in highschool by creating small games in Python.
        One of the first projects that really solidified my love for coding was when I recreated the classic The Oregon Trail game.
        Starting college, I began to explore more programming classes and have continued learning ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        &emsp; &emsp; &ensp;
        I have earned my undergraduate degree at Texas State University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied Mathematics.
        Some of the courses I took include Machine Learning, Parallel Programming, Database Systems, Cybersecurity, and Operating Systems.
        Throughout my university experience, I've developed a deep fascination for understanding how computers work and ways to improve their efficiency.
        I take great pleasure in knowing precisely what my code is doing and optimizing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &emsp; &emsp; &ensp;
        In addition to coding, I'm an avid gamer and have even built my own gaming PC.
        I love roguelike games, role playing games, first person shooters, and strategy games.
        Some of my favorite games include Fallout New Vegas, Mass Effect, Citizen Sleeper, and FTL: Faster Than Light.
        However, I also enjoy board games/TCGs with friends such as Magic The Gathering which I play every Thursday with a local group.
        When I'm not coding or gaming, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors, playing tennis, and going bowling.
      </p>
